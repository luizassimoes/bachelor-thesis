# Validation of remote-control use cases for construction and mining robots via 5G

### Bachelor Thesis


In this folder, you can see all the codes used to develop my Bachelor's Thesis. 

Some details you should understand to navigate through the folders:
  1) All of the codes are in Jupyter Notebook. There are three of them: one for the Construction Site part, and two for the Underground Mine. 
  2) All three codes are inside the same folder as the README file, starting with "codes-".
  3) UM stands for Underground Mine, and CS stands for Construction Site.
  4) The plot PDF files are generated in the 'Graphics' folder.
  5) All of the measurement data are contained in the 'Measurements' folder.
  6) The official final document is the Luiza_Souza_Simoes_BT.pdf file.
